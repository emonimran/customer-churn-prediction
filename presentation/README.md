## 📧 Quick Pitch Template

> "I analyzed 7,000+ customer records for a telecom churn prediction project and identified $358K in annual revenue at risk. Using SQL and machine learning, I discovered that month-to-month contract customers churn at 42.7% - 15x higher than long-term contracts. I built a Random Forest model with 85% accuracy to predict high-risk customers, enabling proactive retention campaigns. My recommendations could protect $4.9M in revenue annually."
